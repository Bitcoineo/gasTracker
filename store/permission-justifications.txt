Permission Justifications — ETH Gas Tracker

1. alarms
   The extension uses chrome.alarms to create a recurring 30-second alarm as a safety
   net for polling. The primary polling loop runs every ~13 seconds via setTimeout, but
   Manifest V3 service workers can be terminated by Chrome at any time. The alarm ensures
   the polling chain restarts if the service worker is killed, keeping gas price data
   current without requiring the user to reopen the popup.

2. storage
   The extension uses chrome.storage.local to:
   - Persist the user's EIP-1559 toggle preference across sessions
   - Cache the latest gas price data so the popup displays instantly when opened,
     rather than showing a blank state while waiting for the next API response

3. host_permissions: https://api.blocknative.com/*
   The extension fetches real-time Ethereum gas price estimates from the Blocknative
   Gas Platform API (GET https://api.blocknative.com/gasprices/blockprices). This is
   the sole external API the extension communicates with. No user data is sent — only
   a standard HTTP GET request to a public endpoint. The response contains gas price
   estimates at various confidence levels, which are displayed to the user.
