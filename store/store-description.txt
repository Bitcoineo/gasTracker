ETH Gas Tracker — Real-Time Ethereum Gas Prices

Get instant Ethereum gas price estimates right in your browser toolbar. ETH Gas Tracker pulls live data from the Blocknative Gas Platform API and displays it in a clean, dark-themed popup with three confidence tiers.

THREE GAS TIERS
See gas prices at three confidence levels:
- Fast (99%) — near-certain inclusion in the next block
- Standard (90%) — reliable inclusion for most transactions
- Slow (70%) — lower cost, may take a few extra blocks

Each tier shows the current gwei price, updated every ~13 seconds (approximately once per Ethereum block).

EIP-1559 SUPPORT
Toggle between legacy gas prices and EIP-1559 maxFeePerGas with a single switch. Whether you're using a legacy wallet or a modern EIP-1559-aware client, you'll see the right numbers.

LIVE BADGE
The extension icon displays the current Standard-tier gas price in gwei, color-coded at a glance:
- Green: under 20 gwei
- Yellow: 20-50 gwei
- Orange: 50-100 gwei
- Red: over 100 gwei

No need to open the popup — just glance at the badge to know if it's a good time to transact.

VISUAL COUNTDOWN
A progress bar fills between updates, so you always know when fresh data is arriving. A seconds counter shows exact time since last refresh.

ZERO CONFIGURATION
No API keys, no accounts, no setup. Install and go. The extension uses Blocknative's free Gas Platform API, which requires no authentication.

PRIVACY FIRST
No data collection, no analytics, no tracking. Your preferences are stored locally on your device. The only network request is a simple GET to Blocknative's public gas price endpoint — no user information is transmitted.

LIGHTWEIGHT
Built with vanilla JavaScript and CSS. No frameworks, no bundlers, no dependencies. Manifest V3 compliant with minimal permissions.

Built by Bitcoineo. Gas data powered by Blocknative.
